# Portfolio Website

This website is made to be dynamic, handling all information from *APIs of some sort*.

The aim is to make the portfolio website more robust, so that *all data can be generated from external source*. 

With that, once the coding is completed and established, the website will require *minimum effort to maintain*. 

This would mean that whenever there is an information update, the information can be directly updated from *external APIs*.
